# SVM_Multiclass_Cirrhosis_Prediciton

Utilizing a Support Vector Machine with a polynomial kernel, I meticulously fine-tune the model using GridSearchCV, optimizing hyperparameters to ensure high precision and robust generalization. Post-training, the model predicts class probabilities on the test set, providing a detailed view of its prediction confidence, crucial for informed decision-making. This sophisticated approach exemplifies the depth of modern machine learning, valuable for both competitive and practical applications.
